= Instructions = 

Add Buttons, Widgets and Storefront using the following shortcodes.
You simply enter these codes where you require them to appear on your website.

For a complete storefront you will need to set up your products on the RomanCart Product Manager first, then you can use :
[romancart_storefront]

You can use the catid to open the storefront on a particular category
[romancart_storefront catid=2]

For buy now buttons use:
[romancart_button itemname='A Great Product' price=55]

If you are using the RomanCart Product Manager and have entered your product details onto RomanCart - use the itemcode instead of itemname and price
[romancart_button itemcode='product1']

For Hyperlinks use 
[romancart_link itemname='A Great Product' price=55]

You can use the same parameters as with the buttons.
The full list of parameters are
itemname
itemcode
price
bltext - text for button or link
blclass - specify a class for the button or hyperlink

For Widgets use
[romancart_widget productid=1]
Get the productid from the product properties on the RomanCart Product Manager. Click on the itemcode and it is at the top of the properties on the right.
If you have more than one widget on the page then you need to give each one a number. (The first one does not need a number).

[romancart_widget productid=12 widgetid=2]

Note that you define the actual cart pages on RomanCart as they are hosted pages.
